# Travel Planner Project Progress

## 1. What I’ve Accomplished
- Set up React + Vite project structure.
- Added Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Created core components: Navbar, SearchBar, DestinationCard.
- Designed homepage layout with sample destinations.
- Configured GitHub repository and initial deployment setup.

## 2. Challenges I Faced
- Dependency version conflicts (TailwindCSS installation error).
- Missing plugin '@vitejs/plugin-react' – solved by reinstalling via npm.
- Git push error due to remote mismatch – fixed with 'git pull --rebase'.

## 3. What’s Next (Plan for the Upcoming Week)
- Add more destination details pages with structured data.
- Implement search functionality in the SearchBar to filter destinations.
- Work on responsive UI for mobile and desktop.
- Begin integrating a simple API (Amadeus or mock API) to fetch real travel data.
- Polish the repository with a professional README (features, installation guide, screenshots).
